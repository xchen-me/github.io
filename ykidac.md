## ME5895-001: System Identification and Adaptive Control, Special Topics in Advanced Control Systems, Fall 2015

ME5895-001 is a special topic course intended for all levels of graduate students majoring in Controls and Systems. We will cover three important topics in modern control engineering: **parameterization of all stabilizing controllers (Youla-Kucera parameterization), system identification, and adaptive control**

-   **Homework policy**:

    Homeworks are due in class, before the lecture starts. Late homeworks
    will not be considered in your final grade. If your homework contains
    group work, each group member must specify his/her contributions.

-   **Special Accommodation**:
    Please notify the instructor in writing by the second week of the
    semester, if you have any potential conflict(s) about the class
    schedule, or if you need special accommodations such as:
    disability-related accommodations, emergency medical information you
    wish to discuss with the instructor, or special arrangements in case the
    building must be evacuated.
