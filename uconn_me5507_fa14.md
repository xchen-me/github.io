## UCONN ME5507 Engineering Analysis I, Fall 2014

ME5507 is a first-year graduate course covering topics in mathematics
that are central for solving practical engineering problems. Topics
include but are not limited to: differential equations, matrix and
linear algebra, vector calculus, and selective topics such as
introduction to optimization and probability. It is a prerequisite to
other advanced graduate courses in the UCONN ME department.
