-   *Federal Funding Opportunities for Junior Investigators in System
    Science and Control Engineering*–Special Session at ASME Dynamic
    Systems and Control Conference (DSCC) 2016: served as organizer of
    this special session to bring together program officers from federal
    agencies in a focused panel on funding opportunities for junior
    investigators in the field of dynamic systems and controls.

-   *Open-learning initiative*: instructor and designer of “ME 233:
    Advanced Control Systems II, Spring 2014”—the first graduate-level
    course in System and Controls that was fully webcasted for free to
    YouTube and iTunes-U at the Department of Mechanical Engineering,
    UC Berkeley.

-   *International benchmark on adaptive regulation*: an international
    benchmark on adaptive regulation from 2012-2013 (lead by Dr. Ioan D.
    Landau and supported by European Control Association). The benchmark
    provides an up-to-date scientific evaluation of available procedures
    applicable in the fields of active vibration control and
    noise control.
